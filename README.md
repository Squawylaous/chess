# Chess
This is just a game of chess I'm making to challange myself. main.py is the game. Not much more to add for that.
The game is still a work in progress right now.
I'm planning to make the game more customizable, but the only way to do that right now is editing main.py.
i also gotta finish the game first, so that's coming later.
Thanks for checking this out!
